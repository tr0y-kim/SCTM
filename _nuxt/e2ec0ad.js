Why was there no smart contract TTP matrix?",a:"Smart contracts, fundamental components of blockchain platforms, are designed to facilitate transparent, irreversible transactions and agreements autonomously, contrasting with the malicious intentions often found in typical cyber-attack vectors. However, their unique, constrained application and divergent threat landscape, primarily focusing on the integrity and security of the contractual code and governed assets, present distinctive challenges, rendering the development of a specialized Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTP) matrix a complex endeavor. The rapid evolution and the lack of standardization in smart contract fields, coupled with the prioritization of addressing more immediate and prevalent threats, have possibly delayed the establishment of a specialized and universally applicable TTP matrix for smart contracts.",color:"#5cb85c"},{q:"2.
